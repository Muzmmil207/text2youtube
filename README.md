## Description

The text2youtube is an innovative program that leverages the power of AI and neural networks to automate the process of video content creation. This project aims to streamline the creation of engaging videos by employing advanced AI technologies for scenario generation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video compilation.

## Features

ü§ñ Interacts with OpenAI's ChatGPT to take on various roles like a YouTuber or a YouTube channel.  
üìú Generates captivating video scenarios based on provided content or user inputs.  
üéô Provides video meta information, including video descriptions and names, using ChatGPT.  
üîä Utilizes neural network-based text-to-speech synthesis to create realistic and lifelike audio.  
üé® Crafts compelling search queries for video backgrounds to complement the generated scenarios.  
üåê Downloads suitable videos from YouTube or videoblocks.com based on the crafted search queries.  
‚úÇ Cuts and edits the downloaded videos to synchronize with the synthesized voiceover.  

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Install text-to-speech `pip install git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git`
3. Ensure the `cookies.json` file is present with necessary credentials for **storyblocks.com** website access.
4. Ensure `env.yaml` file is present providing OpenAi API key and working directories
5. Provide the necessary OpenAI prompt in prompts directory
6. Provide the necessary content inputs in text files in SOURCE_DIR
7. Run the main application file `app.py` to start the content creation process.
8. The program will handle the rest, creating engaging videos with captivating voiceovers.
